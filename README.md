# Boa Sim


Boae Sim stands for "Blink of an eye Simulator" is a circuit simulator created with the intention of converging Circuit Creation, Simulation and Synthesis in a single PDK to make it easier for begineers to get into circuit designing. This has been made with myself as the focus and how the Circuit IDE should be.

Currently there is no license associated with the Repo and that will change if the project goes to become bigger. Anyone is free to fork and impove this software as they see fit.
